        What is your why?
      </h2>
      <p class="">
        I find profound purpose in connecting with people, and this philosophy seeps into every area of my life.
        Discovering programming a few years ago was a true blessing as it has now become the main medium I use to
        connect with the world. I treat the code I work on as my children, because when these children grow up and
        mature, they become a life that is capable of impacting as little as a single human or as many as the entirety
        of mankind. Other mediums include content creation in the form of blogs or <a

        a new country, starting a new job, or exploring a new technology.

        ever-evolving world of technology. I generally let my curiosity guide me to new experiences and knowledge,
        which, for example, led me to start learning Go and HTMX which I'm lovin so far.

        What do you enjoy building?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-center">
        What truly drives me is my passion for building impactful software solutions that leverage cutting-edge
        technologies. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of app/web development and technologies like AI, LLMs
        (Large Language Models), HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), and UX (User Experience). By connecting these realms,
        I aim to create innovative applications that solve complex problems with a focus on designing intuitive and
        delightful user experiences.
