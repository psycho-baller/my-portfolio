- I'm currently doing my internship at IBM where we're around like 30 people in a single team. I used to think that our team is especially bad in managing projects and people.
- now, I believe I have gotten a better perspective on what really is going on thanks to our group project
- One key principle I have learned is the importance of splitting the group in small chunks (maybe like 3-5 people) and have 1 leader who deeply cares about a certain project.
	- It is obviously very important for everyone to care deeply, but unfortunately the chances of that happening is quite low.
	- at least if the leader cares deeply, everyone under their leadership would get a boost in their "care"(In other words, more motivated to work on the project).
	- I have even felt that with one of the projects i was assigned to in work. We were a group of three and one of us were extremely motivated. As a result, I was inspired by him and found myself working even harder on that project
- chaos and confusion happens when the leader is not aware of what's going on, which happens when they're not interested in the project/product.
- there could also be a team that has a great leader but because the team is over 10 people, that boost of "care" is so spread out that it no longer "boosts"
