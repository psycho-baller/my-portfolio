## Why should you care about momentum?

Do you struggle to always get started on things you wanna work on? Do you find it hard to continue after getting started on something? Well today I'll be telling you about the power of momentum and how you can leverage it to propel you towards the life you wanna live

### What is momentum?

If you're not sure what momentum means, well it's a powerful force that can play a significant role in various aspects of our lives, including our personal goals, work, habits, and overall productivity. It's a concept borrowed from physics, where momentum is the product of mass and velocity, but in a more metaphorical sense, it represents the cumulative force generated by continuous action towards our goals. Just as a moving train gains speed and becomes harder to stop, our actions, when consistently directed towards a purpose, create a momentum that propels us forward. This momentum can help us break through barriers, overcome challenges, and accelerate our progress more swiftly. It's this momentum that can turn small, daily actions into significant achievements over time
I will share 3 things I do everyday to take advantage of the power of momentum then I'll quickly go through 8 other ways you can leverage that power

### How to leverage the power of momentum

- Before we even start talking about the morning we need to talk about what you should do before going to bed. I noticed on the days where I wake up not knowing what I'm gonna do. I end up defaulting to working on things that don't really matter to me. In that case momentum is pushing you towards the easiest or the simplest task your brain finds in the morning and also you'll be lucky if you don't get distracted and waste your time on something you never intended or would intend to do. This is why it is essential to plan ahead the day before(or first thing in the morning), writing it down for you to easily see it to remind yourself what you wanted do for this day. Bonus points for being specific on what you intend to do.
  - another advantage to this is, you'll be excited to wake up and start your day since you know what you're gonna be working on and hopefully it's something that excites you rather than waking up with no direction
  - the key here is the intention, not just writing it down. You have to believe that you're actually going to work on that thing and this is where honesty comes into play. You need to be honest with yourself about what you intend to do (esp w time blocking). For ex, do you really see yourself reading this book when you first wake up for 1 hour. The point of this is not to try to set up the perfect day, the goal is to give yourself a mental and physical note about what you intend to work on today which will, as a result, make it significantly easier for you to actually do that thing because now when you wake up, your brain will not try to find something to do (which will eventually cause decision fatigue, but that's a whole another video), instead, you already have a defined path you carved out for yourself the previous day.

one advice that I'd like to share regarding planning your day is, generally we have a tendency to prioritize short-term rewards rather than long-term. You might think "oh I know this, I obviously prefer eating chocolates over reading a book". But what people, including my past self, don't take into account that it also applies to the work you decide to do. You might work on things that offer you great short-term rewards, which is good except that you might be shadowing long-term rewards that could benefit you more in the long run. unfortunately to be aware of these things, you do need to plan your life and where you see yourself five or 10 years from now. You can find a lot of books or YouTube videos that can guide you through that process or you can just wait for me to make one.

Now for the second thing i do, start your day off with any sort of exercise. the key here is to feel a sense of accomplishment because that would boost your confidence in yourself. I'm not asking you to have a whole workout, but feel free to do so.Â  I just do push-ups until I can't anymore at the least, and sometimes I run in the mornings. Remember though, for the purpose of momentum, It's not about how much you do, it's about just reaching a point where you've exhausted your body because that will make you feel like you're on top of the world just for a split second. My favorite part is when I first stand up after my push-ups with my face being extremely red, I feel temporarily exhausted, but extremely powerful. I feel like I could win Mohammad Ali in a boxing match, in other words you feel like the sky is the limit for you and this is actually one of the benefits of working out in general but that's a topic for another video. So now when you start working on the thing you intended to do in the morning, you will be going to it with a sense of accomplishment carrying you forward, and thanks to momentum, It will push you towards continuing that sense of accomplishment by completing the task that you intended to work on.

[[Start everything in action]]: now this one is a habit that can be used all the time and in several situations. When meeting up with your friends, colleagues, strangers, anyone. I think the hardest part of conversations are their beginnings. I believe makings small talk is harder than having an actual conversation, but extreme extraverts might disagree with that. but anyways, one thing that helped me at the start of a conversation is being on the move, when you're just sitting and doing nothing it's hard for you and for them to start a conversation, but when you're in an action state and doing something, it will be easier for you to think of something to talk about. You're not overthinking because you're too busy doing something. this is something that I actually learned from improv. There is this game where two people have a conversation where the first letter of the first word they say should follow the alphabet so let's say the other person starts their sentence with an "A" and then I have to start my sentence with a "B" and so on. Something profound happens when you actually play that game, you stop overthinking what you wanna say because you're mind is too busy with three things: keeping track of the next letter in the alphabet, finding a word that starts with that certain letter, and listening to what the other person is saying. You become too busy to feel nervous so you have no capacity to overthink, even when performing for a crowd. All of this to say, don't just stand there, do something. But also don't try to find something to do as a way to hide your nervousness because the other person would be able to see that.

- now before I share the eight other ways, i'd like to say that we all live unique lives so I recommend you to always be on the lookout for ways you can momentumize **your** day,
  - Always ask yourself. "How can I set up my day in a way that would leverage the power of momentum to my advantage", and also, at the end of the day, you can ask yourself "what's something that I want to do but I can't get myself to start". You'll be surprised with how much smoothly your day could flow with momentum backing you. it can help you build new habits. Speaking of [[habits]] there's a lot to say about the intersection of habits and momentum but basically they both make starting hard things, easy
    - Habits themselves is a way you can smoothen out your day thanks to momentum built from the past years you've been doing an activity like brushing your teeth

- [[Four Thousand Weeks Highlights#focus on what you've already completed, not just what you've got to complete]]

- Give yrself small wins throughout the day. Remind yrself of what you've accomplished and move on w the rest of the day

- **Establish Clear Goals:** Set precise objectives to give your actions a sense of purpose and direction, initiating momentum

- **Avoid Zero Days**: A zero day is when you don't do anything towards your goal. Try to avoid these by doing at least one thing every day that moves you forward, even if it's just for a few minutes. Consistency is critical to build and maintain momentum

- **Surround Yourself with Motivators**: Engage with people, content, and environments that motivate you. Having positive influences can reinforce your drive to keep moving forward.

- **Stay Organized**: Keep your workspace and schedule organized to minimize friction that can slow down your momentum. A clutter-free environment can help you focus and be more efficient.

- **Rest and Recover**: Momentum doesn't mean non-stop action. Schedule breaks and take time to rest. Burnout can kill momentum, so balance your hard work with adequate rest.

- **Keep the Big Picture in Mind**: Remember why you started and what you're working towards. Keeping your ultimate goal in mind can help you push through the moments when momentum starts to wane.

- **Build on Existing Habits**: Attach new goals to habits you already have. For example, if you want to start journaling or working out more, consider setting a rule where you cannot have dinner until you spend 15 minutes journaling, or doing 20 pushups. These rules will eventually become part of your daily routine for dinner

- Speaking of habits, I've been trying to create and break habits these past few months and I've learned a lot through that process. Let me know in the comments if you'd like me to share what I've learned. And also don't forget to share this with a friend who might benefit from the power of momentum. With that being said, have a wonderful rest of your day
