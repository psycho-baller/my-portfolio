## A cool story about how indecisiveness almost got me killed

Today I realized what a series of horrible decisions does to a man like me. It just gives me more hope that everything will work out. I oversleep coz I forget to change my alarm... AGAIN. I see it's raining, idk what to do. It's never good when idk what to do. The more I go through life the more I realize how important decisiveness is. And on that morning, I had none of it. I start by seeing if I can fix the front wheel splash guard of my bike so I don't get all the water from the floor splashing on my face and while I was trying to get some part out I break my bike lock... now you might be asking... how the hell did you break your bike lock while trying to fix yr bike... coz I used it as a tool... I'll just leave it at that. Further explanation would just make me sound dumber than I already am.

Now back to dealing with the existential question of whether I wanna stay and work from home, bike to the office, or take the bus to the office. Forecast says it will be raining but I don't see any rain outside so I decided that this is my cue to leave and bike to the office and so I did. I start biking. Literally 1 minute into my ride it starts raining and I think to myself. 'I can still go to the bus stop and wait in the shade for my bus but ofc I didn't do that,' I kept going. Halfway through I see an old man walking with his head directed towards the floor. I think to myself... how should I maneuver this guy... I end up not doing anything until I became too close to him and knew that I would crash into him so I hard break and start sliding through the wet floor but obviously I didn't have enough grip to stop on time but I did manage to turn slightly right but not enough so I end up hitting the part between his ribs and waist (I hope so) and I somehow manage to stay on the bike (last time I hit smone I fell). I finally stop the bike and look back to see the damage I created but thankfully the old man was standing tall... but in confusion. We stare at each other for what felt like an eternity, then, I nervously put my thumbs up to signify me asking him if he was alright because that's the logical things to do when you hit someone with your e-bike. He didn't give any reaction so I just continued biking. At this point the rain was unforgiving and I lost all hope that I would be able to arrive to the office in an acceptable manner. The rain just kept increasing in volume and the puddles got splashier.

As I approached the final traffic light. I see that it was orange then turned red. I hate these situations where I could risk it and make it through the other side or just slow down and take my time.

At this point I just lost sense of reality. I couldn't give two shits about my fully soaked clothes or anything really. I stop pedaling and start thinking to myself. 'Do I wanna interrupt the momentum of my moving bike and play it safe in case there's a cop around? Or do I go all in and pedal as fast as I can to cross the zebra line before the bus' stop light turns green.' Well I do neither, I didn't feel like reacting to anything at all. I've reached a point where I've done so many bad decisions that I no longer wanna make any more decisions. I just let the momentum do it's thing and hoped that I could cross the road before the bus' stop light turns green.

As I got closer to the bus, I noticed the bus got off the breaks. At this point I was too fast and too far in to give up. I had no choice but to continue moving. As it starts to accelerate, i was right in front of it. Basically a few centimeters away from it's hood. Luckily, I was able to pass through untouched thanks to the bus driver slamming the breaks with the aftermath being the loud horn of the bus indicating the driver's disapproval of my actions.

Looking back at it now, a small part of me believes that I didn't actually take no action (break or pedal). I just subconsciously knew I would make it through. But nah it's just decision fatigue knocking on my door in the worst possible moment. Or maybe it's because I just finished listening to [[Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow]] which talks about how you have unlimited retries in video games so it's not a big deal if I fail.

But realistically speaking it was most likely just some kind of defense mechanism. I didn't wanna deal w the consequences of my actions so I took no actionðŸ¤¯. I mean this whole thing happened as a result of me not being decisive. Thinking about it now, most of the actions I take when I'm in an indecisive state turn out to negatively affect me, or at least have the potential to. Which kinda makes sense. Even if you took the 'right' action, the fact that you are not sure about your decision shows that you don't trust yourself, which obviously will negatively affect your performance in that action.

Indecisiveness is sometimes that I've struggled with a lot recently. And today it showed me how a series of indecisive actions can get you killed.

## Purpose of this post

This is my first time I ever share a personal story from my life to the world. I'm hoping it would serve as a reminder for me to strive to become someone who's decisive. I guess a call for help to anyone who overcame their indecisiveness. Please let me know what helped you. And the final reason is I also wanted to get better at storytelling so if you've got any feedback on how my storytelling could be better in any way please contact me through any of the links below:
