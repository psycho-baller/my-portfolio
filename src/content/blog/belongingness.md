- In our journey through life, there's an often overlooked but crucial aspect that shapes our experiences - the sense of belonging. Today, we'll delve into the profound impact of belonging, its significance in our lives, and how you can cultivate it.
- In the vast landscape of our existence, the workplace stands as a significant arena where the feeling of belonging can truly thrive
	- We spend half of our lives in there
	- When you feel a sense of belonging at work, it goes hand in hand with a feeling of purposefulness, the feeling of working on something that's greater than you, which is one of the major contributors to happiness in our lives. Working towards a common goal, just like being on a sports team can give you a boost of motivation because you're not only doing the work for yourself, but you're also doing it for the team and everyone that gets impacted by what you do.
	- And this is where job satisfaction comes from, not from how much you earn
- One thing that people don't realize about the sense of belonging is that it begins within us. And that is something that I did not understand few years ago. I didn't feel like I belonged and I  believed the issue was the people when in reality it was me.
	- Many of us, at times, feel the need to wear a mask, concealing our true selves. This act undermines the essence of belonging, signaling to our subconscious that we don't truly fit in and that we feel the need to wear a mask to feel safe and valued
	- Going through life is a war and fighting it out all by yourself is not how you win a war. And putting a mask on is even worse because that is like going on a war against yourself
- after reflecting on my past experiences and why I felt the need to put on a mask. I came up with a very profound realization.
	- the root cause of me feeling like I didn't belong anywhere was in the fact that I did not value myself 
	- You see when you don't value yourself, how do you expect other people to value you?
	- Now this might sound a lil too hippie but hear me out
		- Belonging transcends individual relationships; it extends to our connection with the universe, with god. When you believe you have a strong purpose in this universe, a sense of belonging within yourself naturally follows.
		- The value you place on yourself echoes in how the world perceives you
	- Another important point to notice is that you feel like you belong in the place you contribute to.
- Based on what we discussed, we can notice 2 positive feedback loops that we can take advantage of
	- when you value yourself, others will value you, and when others value you, you value yourself
	- When you voluntarily contribute to a certain group, the more you feel like you belong to that group, and when you feel like you belong to that group, you contribute more to it.
- keep in mind that there is an infinite amount of ways you can give value to a group of people or to the world, it could be as little as sharing a smile to stranger, inspiring people, listening to and empathizing with your friends, or even sharing a funny story that makes your friends laugh. The list is endless...
	- But remember, Authenticity is key, allow your kindness to emanate naturally from your heart, as most individuals can discern between genuine warmth and insincere gestures.
- So, to conclude, the sense of belonging is woven from the threads of authenticity, self-value, and a connection to something greater. As you navigate through life, remember that you are never alone. Embrace the true self you wanna be, contribute your unique value, and you'll find that the world, in all its vastness, is a place where you truly belong
