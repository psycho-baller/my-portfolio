I believe there is no better time to learn something new than being in an environment that's new. There's something about us where if we change one aspect of our external world, we become less resistant to change and growth within ourselves.

I experienced this firsthand when I first traveled to Calgary. Before arriving, I was a shy and socially awkward person who valued everyone over myself. Some people even considered me a people pleaser. In all honesty, I didn't like the person I was back then. I attempted to change, but unfortunately when an environment expects you to act a certain way, you tend to subconsciously conform to those expectations, especially as a people pleaser.

Traveling to Calgary presented me with a fresh opportunity to mold myself into the person I desired to become. Looking back at it now, I am certain that this was the best decision I've ever made in my life. Now, I have been given another opportunity to radically transform who I am by traveling to Berlin where I'll be enrolled in Software Entrepreneurship courses.

One thing I discovered about myself during my transformation is that I find profound purpose in improving peoples (mental) health through building software products that are heavily influenced by the latest scientific/psychological research

Upon graduating, I aim to become a startup founder for a product that does just that. However, being an Entrepreneur and a startup founder is easier said than done. It requires being able to make a positive impact on your users and workers, which necessitates a deep understanding of entrepreneurial techniques. But most importantly, I've noticed that what sets a good entrepreneur from a bad one is the kind of person they are deep down. This is precisely what I intend to cultivate during my time in Berlin: transforming myself into the type of person who excels in entrepreneurship, in the hope of thriving as a software startup founder upon graduation.
