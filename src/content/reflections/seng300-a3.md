For this project, I decided to take lead on setting up the environment so that it would be easier for my teammates to get started

To my surprise, I was the only person who had experience with using git and github, so I took the time to teach my teammates how to start using these tools.

One frustrating thing I faced during this assignment was the lack of support that I received from my TAs. wouldn't respond and others would take a week to respond, just to provide me with a basic answer. Looking at the bright side, I considered this a learning experience, as I had to figure out most of the problems on my own by going through several trials and errors.
